One of the goals of the architecture initiative is to develop a process for requesting a performing architecture reviews. We will kick things off with the following informal process. This is intended to be a "draft" process which will be refined and improved as we learn more about what works and what does not.

- Anyone can request an architecture review for something they are working on and anyone on the team can suggest an architecture review be done on something they are not working on.
- Architecture reviews would ideally happen before the bulk of the coding has happened, but if people want feedback after implementation that can happen too.
- Anyone who is interested can participate in the review as a reviewer
- Devs will email dev@dimagi.com to initiate a review. In that email they should propose a time, and provide any supporting documents for reviewers to look over before the review session. For example, this document could be a diff containing new classes and method stubs, or it might be a google doc describing the changes to be made.
- During the review, the dev will give a short overview to those present about the problem they are trying to solve, and how they are proposing to solve it
